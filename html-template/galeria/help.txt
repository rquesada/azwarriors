This is the help file for the 3D Image Gallery sold on Flashden.net by ath92.


Hi and thanks for buying my file!



Let's start with something that might make you happy: The 3D Image Gallery is actually very ease to use!
Basicly, the only things you have to do is to upload the right images and change the gallery.xml file properly,
which will be explained underneath.

First of all, you will need to put your own images in the right place. I recommend to create a seperate folder for that,
but it is not needed, for you will have to put the URL of all the images inside the gallery.xml file.

So when you have the right images in tehe right place, let's start changing the gallery.xml file. 
The structure is something like this:

<gallery>
	<category name="This Name">
		<item url="images/image.jpg" title="A Flower">
		<![CDATA[This is the description(which can contain HTML!)]]>
		</item>
	</category>
</gallery>

As you have probably seen in the preview file, the gallery can contain different categories. Every category is defined
by the <category> tag. The name attribute of this tag changes the name of the gallery, which you will only see 
in the categories sidebar.

To make the gallery work for you, you will have to put an <item> tag (like the 3rd line of the XML-script above) for every 
image you have in the gallery.xml file. The url you put into the XML file can be a relative one (for example images/image.jpg)
But you can also use an absolute url (for example: http://www.flasden.net/image.jpg). The url is probably case-sensitive,
but that depends on the server you are running the application on. Ofcourse, you will have to put the right <item> tag
inside the right <gallery> tag.

So the url handles the loading of the image, but there are two more things: "title" and some text that's between the
<item> and </item> tags. The function of the "title" parameter is pretty obvious, it's just the title of the image.
Change it, and you'll be able to see the change when you press the info button underneath an image inside the gallery.

The text between the <item> and </item> tags is the discription of the text. This description is placed between <![CDATA[
and ]]> tags, which makes it possible to put HTML into the text. If you remove it, you won't be able to do that anymore,
but some of you might not need it anyway.

The description text can parse simple HTML and CSS. The CSS file is called infoStyleSheet.css. To change this file, basic
knowledge of CSS is recommended. However, since CSS is a very easy language you will probably be able to change some things,
although you haven't got any CSS knowledge at all. If you want to learn more about CSS, I recommend to use this link:

Well, that's about everything you can change within the XML and CSS files. To change more things, you will have to open
the .FLA file. If you don't have Flash, but still want to change something you can't change through the XMl file,
please post a comment on Flashden and I might fix it. If I make an update that might help some people out, 
I'll make it available to everyone through a free update, although I can't garuantee I will be able to make updates 
in the long run.

To be able to change the FLA file, you'll first have to install the papervision3d and GTween classes. To do so, first
unwrap the files from the .zip archive and put the org and com folders somewhere easy to find. Then in Flash, go to
edit->preferences and press actionscript and then actionscript 3.0 settings. Press the + sign and add the url of the folder
in which you put the com and org folders. So with that done, you can export the movie without making it not work anymore.

Now you can change just about everything in the file, but I'll explain how some basic things are done. For example the
background, which is just a MovieClip which you can change in the library. It will automatically upscale to the browser
size, so if you use a bitmap image i recommend a large resolution.

The color of the GUI is also very easy to change with only very little knowledge of Flash, and I'm sure you'll be able 
to find out how this works.



If you happen to have any other questions, just ask them and I'll probably answer them! If I don't, just send me an email
and I will ;)
